# Euphony_XY

**An iTunes playlist parser which graphs personal playlists using matplotlib.**

A small project which I did using python, numpy, matplotlib and plistlib.

##Getting started

Just clone and run the script using :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sudoankit/Euphony_XY.git

$ cd Euphony_XY

$ python main.py --[options given below] [xml file] [xml file]


```


The parser has 4 options namely : 
- Comparing two playlists for duplicates [takes two files] `--dup`
- Finding common tracks across playlists `--common` 
- Plot a scatter plot between sepcified labels `--statsS`
- Plot a histogram between specified labels`--statsH`

Enjoy!

  
##Room for improvement

Future updates include :
- A option to find correlation coefficient.
- More graph options
- Maybe make a D3.js wrapper.
- Python 3 support
- much more
- and more
